## Installation

* After cloning the repo, please run 'npm install' to get the dependent modules (e.g. inquirer, jest, etc.).

## Usage

After the modules are installed, run by typing 'node index.js' or 'npm start' from the terminal.  You will then be prompted with a series of logo design questions.
* -e will generate SVG's for every 'answers' object in answers.js
* -o will send the answers object to console after your inputs so that you can add to the answers.js more easily.
